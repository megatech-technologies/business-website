        <div class="card-summary">

          <p>
            Drivers are one of the most important but least understood parts of any Windows computer. Every piece of hardware inside your system depends on drivers to communicate with Windows. Without drivers, your keyboard would not type, your screen would stay black, your Wi-Fi would not connect, and your sound would remain silent.
          </p>

          <p>
            In simple terms, drivers act as translators between Windows and your computer hardware. They allow Windows to understand how to control devices such as graphics cards, network adapters, printers, webcams, and storage drives.
          </p>

          <p>
            This article explains why Windows driver updates matter, how they affect system performance, how they prevent errors, and why learning about drivers is essential for students, technicians, and everyday computer users.
