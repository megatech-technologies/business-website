        <h3 class="card-title">What Is a Windows License?</h3>

        <div class="card-summary">

          <p>
            A Windows license is Microsoft’s official permission that allows you to legally use the Windows operating system on a computer. 
            When Windows asks for activation, it is verifying that your copy is genuine and properly authorized.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many beginners think activation is optional, but in reality, licensing is a critical part of how Windows works. 
            It ensures fairness, security, updates, and long-term system stability.
          </p>

          <h4>Understanding Windows Activation</h4>

          <p>
            Activation is the process where Windows confirms your license with Microsoft servers. Once activated, Windows unlocks full functionality and verifies that your installation complies with Microsoft’s usage terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Without activation, Windows still runs, but with limitations such as watermark messages, restricted personalization, and potential update issues.
          </p>

          <h4>What Exactly Is a Windows License?</h4>

          <p>
            A Windows license is not just a serial number. It is a legal agreement between the user and Microsoft that defines how Windows can be installed and used.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each license allows Windows to be activated on a specific number of devices depending on the license type.
          </p>

          <h4>Why Licensing Exists</h4>

          <p>
            Microsoft licenses Windows to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Protect intellectual property</li>
            <li>Prevent software piracy</li>
            <li>Ensure quality updates</li>
            <li>Provide customer support</li>
            <li>Maintain system security</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Licensing also helps businesses stay compliant with legal and regulatory requirements.
          </p>

          <h4>Product Key vs Digital License</h4>

          <p>
            Windows can be activated using either a product key or a digital license.
          </p>

          <p>
            A product key is a 25-character code formatted like this:
          </p>

          <p>
            XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
          </p>

          <p>
            A digital license, on the other hand, links Windows activation directly to your Microsoft account or hardware. No manual key entry is required after initial activation.
          </p>

          <h4>Digital License Explained</h4>

          <p>
            Digital licenses are automatically created when Windows is activated for the first time on a device. The license becomes tied to your system hardware and Microsoft account.
          </p>

          <p>
            If Windows is reinstalled on the same machine, it usually activates automatically once connected to the internet.
          </p>

          <h4>Common Types of Windows Licenses</h4>

          <p>
            There are several Windows license categories:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Retail License – purchased separately</li>
            <li>OEM License – pre-installed by manufacturers</li>
            <li>Volume License – used by organizations</li>
            <li>Education License – for schools</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Retail License</h4>

          <p>
            Retail licenses are bought directly from Microsoft or authorized sellers. They can usually be transferred to another computer if removed from the original system.
          </p>

          <h4>OEM License</h4>

          <p>
            OEM licenses come pre-installed on laptops and desktops. These licenses are permanently tied to the hardware and cannot be transferred.
          </p>

          <h4>Volume Licensing</h4>

          <p>
            Large organizations use volume licenses to activate many computers under a single agreement. This is common in offices, schools, and institutions.
          </p>

          <h4>Education Licensing</h4>

          <p>
            Microsoft provides special licenses for students and teachers, often free or discounted, to support learning environments.
          </p>

          <h4>How to Check Your Windows License Status</h4>

          <p>
            Users can verify activation by opening:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Settings</li>
            <li>System</li>
            <li>Activation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>

            IT technicians must understand licensing to properly install systems, manage upgrades, and maintain compliance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Incorrect licensing can cause activation failures, software restrictions, and legal issues for organizations.
          </p>

          <h4>Common Activation Problems</h4>

          <p>
            Activation may fail due to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Hardware changes</li>
            <li>Invalid product keys</li>
            <li>Network problems</li>
            <li>License misuse</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Most issues can be resolved using Windows activation troubleshooting tools.
          </p>

          <h4>Legal and Ethical Importance</h4>

          <p>
            Windows licensing is a foundation of modern computing. It protects software integrity, ensures system reliability, and supports education and professional environments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Understanding Windows licenses empowers users to maintain genuine systems and build strong technical knowledge.
          </p><br>

          <h4>How Windows Activation Works</h4>

<p>
Windows activation verifies that your copy of Windows is genuine and properly licensed. During activation, your system communicates with Microsoft servers to confirm that the license key or digital license is valid.
</p>

<p>
Once activated, Windows unlocks all personalization features and receives full updates. Activation also protects users from counterfeit software.
</p>

<h4>Digital Licenses Explained</h4>

<p>
Modern versions of Windows use digital licenses. Instead of typing a product key every time, Microsoft links your Windows activation to your hardware or Microsoft account.
</p>

<p>
This allows automatic reactivation when Windows is reinstalled on the same computer.
</p>

<h4>Product Key Licenses</h4>

<p>
Some Windows editions still use 25-character product keys. These keys are entered manually during installation or activation.
</p>

<p>
They are commonly provided with retail purchases or enterprise deployments.
</p>

<h4>OEM vs Retail Licenses</h4>

<p>
OEM licenses come preinstalled on new computers and are permanently tied to the original hardware. Retail licenses can be transferred to another PC if removed from the old one.
</p>

<p>
Understanding this difference helps users avoid licensing problems when upgrading systems.
</p>

<h4>Volume Licensing</h4>

<p>
Organizations use volume licenses to activate many computers at once. Schools and businesses rely on this system for managing large networks.
</p>

<h4>What Happens When Windows Is Not Activated</h4>

<p>
Unactivated Windows continues working but limits personalization features and displays reminders. Some updates may also be restricted.
</p>

<h4>Common Activation Problems</h4>

<ul>
<li>Hardware changes</li>
<li>Incorrect product keys</li>
<li>Internet connectivity issues</li>
<li>Corrupted system files</li>
</ul>

<p>
These issues are resolved by reconnecting accounts, re-entering keys, or repairing Windows services.
</p>

<h4>Reactivating After Hardware Changes</h4>

<p>
Replacing major components such as motherboards may require reactivation. Users can link licenses to Microsoft accounts to simplify this process.
</p>

<h4>Windows Licensing in Education</h4>

<p>
Schools use Windows licenses to provide students with reliable learning environments. Proper licensing ensures access to security updates and educational tools.
</p>

<h4>Windows Licensing in Business</h4>

<p>
Businesses depend on licensed Windows systems for stability, compliance, and professional operations.
</p>

<h4>Legal Importance of Genuine Windows</h4>
