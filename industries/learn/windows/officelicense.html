        <h3 class="card-title">What Is an Office License?</h3>

        <div class="card-summary">

          <p>
            Microsoft Office is one of the most widely used productivity software suites in the world. From students writing assignments to businesses managing finances, Office plays a major role in everyday digital work. However, to unlock its full capabilities, Microsoft Office requires proper licensing.
          </p>

          <p>
            An Office license is Microsoft’s official authorization that allows you to install and use Office applications legally. Just like Windows, Office uses activation to confirm that your copy is genuine.
          </p>

          <h4>Why Microsoft Office Requires Licensing</h4>

          <p>
            Licensing protects Microsoft’s intellectual property while ensuring users receive secure updates and technical support. When Office is activated, Microsoft verifies that your software complies with usage terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlicensed Office installations operate with limitations and may expose systems to security risks.
          </p>

          <h4>What Exactly Is an Office License?</h4>

          <p>
            An Office license is a legal agreement between Microsoft and the user. It defines how Office applications can be installed, how many devices are allowed, and whether the software can be transferred.
          </p>

          <p>
            This license is enforced through online activation or product keys.
          </p>

          <h4>Office Activation Explained</h4>

          <p>
            Activation confirms that your Office copy is genuine. Once activated, all features become available, including cloud syncing, advanced editing tools, and collaboration services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Without activation, Office applications may enter reduced functionality mode.
          </p>

          <h4>Types of Microsoft Office Licenses</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Subscription Licenses (Microsoft 365)</li>
            <li>Lifetime Licenses (Office 2019, 2021, etc.)</li>
            <li>Volume Licenses</li>
            <li>Education Licenses</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Subscription Licensing (Microsoft 365)</h4>

          <p>
            Microsoft 365 uses a subscription model. Users pay monthly or yearly and receive continuous updates, cloud storage, and access across multiple devices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Subscription licenses include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneDrive, and Teams.
          </p>

          <p>
            As long as the subscription remains active, users enjoy the latest Office features.
          </p>

          <h4>Lifetime Office Licenses</h4>

          <p>
            Lifetime licenses are one-time purchases. Examples include Office 2019 and Office 2021. These versions do not require ongoing payments but also do not receive major feature updates.
          </p>

          <p>
            Users keep the software permanently on one computer.
          </p>

          <h4>Volume Licensing</h4>

          <p>
            Organizations use volume licensing to install Office on many computers under one agreement. This is common in schools, offices, and institutions.
          </p>

          <h4>Education Licensing</h4>

          <p>
            Microsoft provides free or discounted Office licenses to students and educators. These licenses support digital learning and classroom productivity.
          </p>

          <h4>Product Key vs Digital License</h4>

          <p>
            Office can be activated using a 25-character product key or through a digital license linked to your Microsoft account.
          </p>

          <p>
            Digital licenses simplify reinstallation by remembering your activation automatically.
          </p>

          <h4>How to Check Office Activation Status</h4>

          <p>
            You can check activation by opening any Office app and navigating to Account settings. This shows license type and activation state.
          </p>

          <h4>Common Office Licensing Problems</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Expired subscriptions</li>
            <li>Invalid product keys</li>
            <li>Account login issues</li>
            <li>Device limit exceeded</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Most issues can be resolved by signing into your Microsoft account or using Microsoft’s activation troubleshooter.
          </p>

          <h4>Why Office Licensing Matters in Education</h4>

          <p>
            Licensed Office ensures students have access to modern tools for assignments, presentations, and collaboration. Schools depend on genuine Office software for reliable learning environments.
          </p>

          <h4>Office Licensing for Professionals</h4>

          <p>
            Businesses rely on licensed Office software for documentation, accounting, communication, and planning. Proper licensing prevents workflow disruptions and legal risks.
          </p>

          <h4>Security Benefits of Licensed Office</h4>

          <p>
            Licensed Office receives regular security updates that protect against viruses and exploits. This keeps user data safe.
          </p>

          <h4>Ethical Use of Software</h4>

          <p>
            Using licensed Office supports software development and protects users from pirated versions that often contain malware.
          </p>

          <h4>Career Importance of Office Licensing Knowledge</h4>

          <p>
            IT technicians and support professionals must understand Office licensing to install systems correctly and assist users effectively.
          </p>

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>

          <p>
            An Office license represents trust, legality, and access to powerful productivity tools. Understanding Office licensing is essential for students, businesses, and technology professionals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Learning how Office licenses work prepares you for real-world computing and professional environments.
