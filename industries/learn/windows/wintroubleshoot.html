<p>
Hard drives also fail over time. Checking disk health helps prevent sudden data loss.
</p>

<h4>Solving Application Crashes</h4>

<p>
Applications crash when system resources are exhausted or dependencies are missing. Reinstalling affected software, updating Windows, and clearing temporary files often restores stability.
</p>

<h4>Event Viewer for Error Analysis</h4>

<p>
Event Viewer records system activities and errors. Technicians use this tool to trace failures and identify problematic services or drivers.
</p>

<h4>Network Troubleshooting Techniques</h4>

<p>
Advanced network troubleshooting includes resetting network adapters, flushing DNS cache, and reinstalling network drivers.
</p>

<p>
These steps resolve most internet connectivity problems.
</p>

<p>
Printers and external devices fail mainly due to driver conflicts. Removing and reinstalling drivers restores functionality.
</p>

<h4>Windows Update Troubleshooting</h4>

<p>
Failed updates are common. Clearing update cache folders and restarting Windows Update services usually fixes stuck installations.
</p>

<h4>Restoring Performance</h4>

<p>
Performance issues are often caused by background processes, malware, or insufficient storage. Task Manager identifies resource-heavy programs, allowing users to optimize performance.
</p>

<h4>Recovering Lost Files</h4>

<p>
Accidental deletions can be reversed using Recycle Bin or backup systems. Maintaining backups ensures data recovery during emergencies.
</p>

<h4>Professional Troubleshooting Workflow</h4>

<p>
IT professionals follow structured methods:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify symptoms</li>
